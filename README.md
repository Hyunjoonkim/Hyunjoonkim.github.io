#1.	Introduction
\tIn many countries, a lack of hydrogen refueling station (HRS) infrastructure is a major barrier for Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEV) to become more popular. The high-priced installation cost of HRS make the governments afford to place a limited number of HRSs in a short period time. This paper attempts to find optimal locations of one or two HRSs for the cases in which HRSs are deployed incrementally based on FCEV market development that is currently difficult to foresee. 
\tIn this paper, we propose a location optimization model applied to the context of a large city like Paris where fuel prices in general are higher than in the outskirts and where refueling stations attract car owners or taxi drivers who are looking for a HRS close to their parking lot. The incremental deployment of an HRS network that we propose must be able to attract at least a minimum number of customers corresponding to an initial investment payback period of 5 years maximum.
\tOur assumptions are as follows. The HRS deploying policy in a large metropolis aims to develop an extensive HRS network. The attractiveness of the new HRSs will therefore be essentially due to the proximity of the customers it wishes to attract. Choosing initially to maximize the number of customers will only bring a new HRS closer to the old ones, which we want to avoid. A minimum number of customers will be enough to start with a sufficient load factor. The two objectives of our model are:
- To ensure that the HRSs are as far as possible from each other
- To get as close as possible to a limited number of customers but sufficient to ensure a HRS investment payback period of 5 years maximum and also to capture these customers thanks to a minimal distance from their parking place.
