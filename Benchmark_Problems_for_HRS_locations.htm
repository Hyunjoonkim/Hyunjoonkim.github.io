1.	Introduction
In many countries, a lack of hydrogen refueling station (HRS) infrastructure is a major barrier for Fuel Cell Electric Vehicles (FCEV) to become more popular. The high-priced installation cost of HRS make the governments afford to place a limited number of HRSs in a short period time. This paper attempts to find optimal locations of one or two HRSs for the cases in which HRSs are deployed incrementally based on FCEV market development that is currently difficult to foresee. 
In this paper, we propose a location optimization model applied to the context of a large city like Paris where fuel prices in general are higher than in the outskirts and where refueling stations attract car owners or taxi drivers who are looking for a HRS close to their parking lot. The incremental deployment of an HRS network that we propose must be able to attract at least a minimum number of customers corresponding to an initial investment payback period of 5 years maximum.
Our assumptions are as follows. The HRS deploying policy in a large metropolis aims to develop an extensive HRS network. The attractiveness of the new HRSs will therefore be essentially due to the proximity of the customers it wishes to attract. Choosing initially to maximize the number of customers will only bring a new HRS closer to the old ones, which we want to avoid. A minimum number of customers will be enough to start with a sufficient load factor. The two objectives of our model are:
•	To ensure that the HRSs are as far as possible from each other
•	To get as close as possible to a limited number of customers but sufficient to ensure a HRS investment payback period of 5 years maximum and also to capture these customers thanks to a minimal distance from their parking place.
2.	Benchmark Problems
Given that a set of HRSs are already located, we propose to locate incrementally one or two new HRSs at the saturation point when all HRSs have nmax of customers.
We represent the city of Paris (11 km x 9 km) by a rectangular grid defined from (0,0) to (110,90) with 10,101 possible locations in which new HRSs can be located. The first existing HRS is installed close to Pont de l’Alma (see Figure 1). Considering that taxis are moving everywhere within the city, we assume that demand points are uniformly distributed in the city. Each HRS can supply a maximum of 200 kg/day which corresponds to a maximal number of customers per day nmax = 125. In appendix 1, we calculate the minimum number of customers to attract to reach the payback period in 5 years, nmin = 36.
We choose 5 cases of incremental HRS launching as follows:
•	Case 1: Extend one existing HRS to two HRSs (one additional HRS)
•	Case 2: Extend two existing HRSs to three HRSs (one additional HRS)
•	Case 3: Extend one existing HRS to three HRSs (two additional HRSs)
•	Case 4: Extend seven existing HRSs to eight HRSs (one additional HRS)
•	Case 5: Extend seven existing HRSs to nine HRSs (two additional HRSs)
